(* resources.ml
   A hashtable of resources, ie images, sounds, or musics.
   This makes sure I don't have to load everything a gajillion
   times and waste lots of space.
   Configs, Scheme programs, and conversations may also eventually be stored 
   here; we'll see how it works.  Realms too.  Hell, everything.

   Just a hashtable and some loading code, really.  
   I rather love hashtables.  ^_^

   There are two options: either it loads all the given resources immediately,
   or it waits until a resource is demanded before loading it.  Startup
   wait vs. runtime wait.  I think I'll go for the latter, since the overall
   effect is probably better and it'll never happen twice.  Yeah.

   So now I'm still worried about what happens if lots of resources are
   loaded and none are ever freed.  I am NOT going to build a conservative
   GC into this thing!  Ah well, it'll probably be okay; the only thing that
   might cause a problem are the sounds.

   The loadFoo funcs are helper.  The getFoo funcs are the interface.
